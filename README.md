# Finding Donors for CharityML

In this project I used several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S.
Algorithms studied here are:

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (GB)
- ADA Bossting

*GB* acheived highest test accuracy at `0.86`.

# Dependecies and packages:

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit learn
- tqtime
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- IPython
